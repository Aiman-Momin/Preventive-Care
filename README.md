PreventiveCare Smart Contract
📜 Description

PreventiveCare is a Move-based smart contract module designed to promote and manage micro-payments for preventive healthcare services on the Aptos blockchain. It enables patients to create healthcare accounts and fund them upfront, allowing authorized healthcare providers to process payments seamlessly upon delivering preventive care.
The contract ensures secure, transparent, and accountable transactions between patients and providers, improving the accessibility and efficiency of healthcare financing.

🎯 Vision
The vision of PreventiveCare is to:
Encourage early intervention and preventive healthcare practices.
Enable micro-payment models in health systems via decentralized finance.
Provide a trustless environment where patients can deposit funds and authorized providers can only access them upon service delivery.
Ensure transparency and accountability in health-related financial transactions.



🔮 Future Scope
Planned enhancements and extensions for the PreventiveCare module include:
Patient portal dApp: A frontend interface to view balance, checkup history, and initiate deposits.
Multi-provider support: Enable multiple trusted providers per patient account.
Insurance integration: Allow insurance smart contracts to auto-fund accounts based on eligibility.
Reward mechanism: Incentivize patients to get timely checkups via token rewards or reduced fees.
Health data interoperability: Link with electronic health records while preserving data privacy and security.
